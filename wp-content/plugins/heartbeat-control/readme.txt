Allows you to easily manage the frequency of the WordPress heartbeat API.

== Description ==

Allows you to easily manage the frequency of the WordPress heartbeat API with just a few clicks.

The heartbeat API can be disabled entirely and allowed for only specific locations.

Heartbeat intervals can be modified between 15 and 300 seconds between requests, saving on server resources.

== Installation ==

1.  Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
1.  Activate Heartbeat Control on the Plugins page.
1.  Adjust any settings within Settings > Heartbeat Control.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change my settings? =

All options are located within Settings > Heartbeat Control.

= Why would I want to change the default heartbeat intervals? =

If you commonly leave your WordPress admin up for long periods of time, especially while writing or editing a post, the repeated POST requests can cause high resource usage.  To avoid this, the heartbeat can be modified or even disabled to lower your server resource usage.
