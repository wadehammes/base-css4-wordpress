Make Your RSS Feeds Look Pretty and Get More Subscribers. Check Out the Before and After Screenshots »

== Description ==

Better RSS Feeds improves the appearance of your RSS feeds and make them human-readable. View the screenshots to see the before and after. Better RSS Feeds also adds subscription buttons and social sharing buttons to your RSS Feeds.

Your blog's RSS feed is located at http://yoursite.com/feed/ (if you use permalinks) or http://yoursite.com/?feed=rss2 (if you don't use permalinks).

Some users already have an RSS viewer installed on their browsers, so their RSS feeds are already human-readable. However, most users (especially on Google Chrome or Apple Safari) do not have an RSS viewer. This plugin makes your RSS feeds accessible to those users.

Currently supported feed readers:

- Feedly
- Digg Reader
- Aol Reader
- The Old Reader

Currently supported sharing buttons:

- Facebook
- Twitter
- Google+

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is RSS? =

RSS feeds are text files used for sharing and distributing new content on blogs. All WordPress blogs have RSS feeds. For example, Smashing Magazine's RSS feed is here: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/feed/

= How does this plugin make my RSS feed look pretty? =

Better RSS Feeds uses a technology called Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) to parse and format your RSS feed. Aside from appearance, nothing else changes.

= I installed the plugin, but my RSS feed is still "ugly" =

You may need to clear your cache and refresh the page. If this does not work, please create a support ticket with your RSS feed's URL and your WordPress installation's version. In the past, plugin conflicts and incorrect server configurations have caused issues.

= Will you add other feed readers? =

Yes. I also plan on letting you choose which feed readers to show.

= Will you add other social sharing buttons? =

Yes. I also plan on letting you choose which buttons to show.
